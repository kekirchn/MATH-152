        "### By: Aziz Albayouk, Tanner Boyea, Kelly Kirchner, August Noe\n",
        "The Collatz Conjecture is an infamous and unsolved problem that states if you take any positive integer and follow the proposed pattern, you will end up in a continuous loop. The idea behind the conjecture is if  you have an even number you simply divide by 2, and if you have an odd number you multiply it by 3 and add 1, the end result should be a continuous loop between 4, 2, and 1. This exploration studies the Collatz Conjecture using Python, studying the dropping times of different inputs and even taking a look at variants of the function and unconventional inputs. "

The output will be a list of integers going through the loop until it reaches the end cycle (the continuous 4, 2, 1)--the code prevents the infinite loop from occuring."

        "The Collatz Conjecture claims to be true while the input is a positive integer, so then what happens when we use a negative number or if we tweak the original equation. Using the encoded conjecture, a negative input will always return an output of 1--since the negative input doesn't meet the main condition. However, if we begin with a negative integer and go through the process by hand (without code), there is no set cycle or value that the function will end on. In terms of variants, of course the first idea we would think of is changing the functions the integers run through. If we change the function that the odd integers go through, even with something as small as changing it to: 3n + 3 or even n - 1, you still end up in a continuous loop but with the loop slightly changing to be multiples of the original loop (i.e. 12, 6, 3; 20, 10, 5 etc) or you'll end up with a very quick and somewhat boring computation.  \n",
