        "### By: Aziz Albayouk, Tanner Boyea, Kelly Kirchner, August Noe\n",
        "The Collatz Conjecture is an infamous problem that states if you take any positive integer and follow the proposed pattern, you will end up in a continuous loop. The idea behind the conjecture is if you have an even number you simply divide by 2, and if you have an odd number you multiply it by 3 and add 1, the end result should be a continuous loop between 4, 2, and 1. Despite it's simplicity, the conjecture remains unsolved but is still studied almost 100 years later. This exploration studies the Collatz Conjecture using Python, studying the dropping times of different inputs and even taking a look at variants of the function and unconventional inputs. "

The output will be a list of integers going through the loop until it reaches the end cycle (the continuous 4, 2, 1)--the code prevents the infinite loop from occuring."

The code below utilizes a while loop to keep track of how many iterations the loop goes through. It is a subtle variation of the base Collatz code that enables us to look at the number of iterations it took before the loop produced an output less than the input. Of course, since the rule for evens will always cause the next number of the sequence to be less than the original input, this code excludes evens and only looks at the dropping time of odds."

Using the encoded conjecture, a negative input will not return an output--since the negative input doesn't meet the main condition. However, if we begin with a negative integer and go through the process by hand (without code), there is no set cycle or value that the function will end on. \n",

If we change the function that the odd integers go through, even with something as small as changing it to: 3n + 3 or even n - 1, you still end up in a continuous loop but with the loop slightly changing to be multiples of the original loop (i.e. 12, 6, 3; 20, 10, 5 etc) or you'll end up with a very quick and somewhat boring computation.  \n",

Essentially we could combine the rules, instead of running them individually, they would reduce down to one rule: (3 * n + 1) / 2. It wouldn't matter if the starting input was odd or even, it would get pushed through the same condition over and over again. This variant doesn't entirely fulfill the Collatz, since with some inputs it will have the Collatz cycle but with others it never reaches one but is just stuck in a never ending process."

There is not one correct method to go about the Collatz Conjecture, it has been around for many years, and has seen countless attempts and techniques to solve it. Many within the math academia say to not try to solve this problem since it is endless and abstract; despite how circular and indefinite it seems to be, the solution or just the different means that will be used to try and solve it might help develop new processes and findings. \n"
